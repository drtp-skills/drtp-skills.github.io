Join us for a day of networking, collaboration and co-creation ✨

This Digital Research Infrastructure & Training Hackathon brings together researchers, developers, and facilitators to share skills, explore new ideas, and hack on projects that strengthen the adoption of digital research infrastructure.

Suggested hackathon topics are creating materials for **demos and training on HPC**, debugging issues with our **mini HPC cluster**, or help develop [Gutenberg](https://train.rse.ox.ac.uk/), an **interactive training platform developed by RSEs** for delivering training in software engineering and research computing related topics to researchers, students and other RSEs. 

We are especially interested in creating materials for domains that aren't already heavy HPC users, so if that's you please come along 💖
