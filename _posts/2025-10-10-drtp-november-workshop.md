-   Registration deadline: 5pm on Thursday 23 October 2025

This event, funded by the UKRI dRTP Skills NetworkPlus Programme, aims to
-   Identify existing dRTP roles, 
-   Identify existing training courses and resources,
-   Link those roles to specific skills / competencies,
-   Align those skills / competencies with the existing training materials. 

The workshop will also identify gaps in provision and areas where new or adapted content is needed, and where teams are working on similar materials and could fruitfully collaborate. Those efforts are another step towards making professional skill development easier and improving career prospects across the whole dRTP ecosystem. The workshop outcomes will be shared with the dRTP community. 

We are hoping to better outline and understand the whole dRTP ecosystem, therefore, we would like to extend an invitation to dRTPs working in different roles and at different institution types, and engaging with a wide range of research communities. 

There will be plenty of opportunities for discussion during the interactive sessions and we look forward to seeing many of you at the event. Please complete the registration form to join. There is no registration fee for the event. The detailed agenda will be circulated close to the event date. 

We would be happy to provide support for a few participants whose organisation/projects cannot cover travel costs. If you would like to attend the event but need any travel support, please apply for the travel support by answering the relevant questions in the registration form.
