**Session Description:**

The goal of this session is to engage the whole dRTP community (research software, research data and research computing infrastructure professionals) in a discussion on what it means for training resources to be FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable  - and to gather feedback on the questionnaire the CHARTED project is creating to evaluate FAIRness of existing training resources. Once completed the questionnaire will also be linked to a set of recommendations and practical guides to help improve existing training resources. 

During this session we will go over the current set of questions (over 130) to categorise them into essential, recommended and nice-to-have elements that contribute to FAIRness of training materials. This interactive activity will allow us to gather the necessary feedback before the questionnaire is implemented as an online tool. 

**Please join us for a discussion on how to create this tool, so that the whole community can benefit from it.**

This session is being organised by [CHARTED](https://drtp-skills.ac.uk/), one of the NetworkPlus projects funded through the UKRI digital Research Technical Professional Skills (dRTP) programme. The project is focused on making the dRTP Skills and Training ecosystem more transparent and easier to navigate for all existing and prospective dRTPs and other stakeholders. One of the project goals is to support the community in making the training resources more FAIR - including providing tools to evaluate FAIRness, guidance on what can be improved and how, and financial support to carry out the work.
